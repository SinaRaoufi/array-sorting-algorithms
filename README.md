# Array sorting algorithms comparison
Comparison of the runtime of array sorting algorithms :card_file_box:


ReadMe will be written soon :construction_worker:

Array is one of the most popular data structures. One of the operations that can be operate on the array is the sort operation. The important point is that not all algorithms are optimal, and some algorithms may perform better than others. So it is important to know which algorithms are optimal and perform better.

Here we have examined the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort


# Requirements
- CMake
- Makefile
- C++ Compiler (GCC is recommended)

```
cmake . -B build
```
After the MakeFile was created:
```
make -C build
```
